# Hi, I'm Ganga Menon

I'm a junior at Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, passionate about **math**, **science**, and building things from scratch.

## What I'm Into

**Maker at Heart** — I love understanding how things work from the ground up. That's what drew me to electrical and electronics engineering — there's something satisfying about turning circuits and code into real products.

**Robotics** — Proud member of my school's robotics team, where I get to combine problem-solving with hands-on building.

**Science Olympiad** — I lead our school's Science Olympiad team, helping organize events and prep teammates for competition.

**Mock Trial** — Part of the Mock Trial team, which has taught me to think on my feet and argue both sides of an issue.

## Beyond Academics

When I'm not studying or building, you'll find me **dancing**, binge-watching cooking shows, or **volunteering** as a mentor for younger students. Giving back and helping kids discover their own interests is something I genuinely enjoy.

## This Site

This is my personal learning notebook where I document what I'm learning — from math to circuits to finance. Feel free to explore!
